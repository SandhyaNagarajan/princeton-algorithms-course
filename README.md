Basic bit comments:
# git checkout -b <branch_name> -t <origin/master>
# git status ; # show modified and added files
# modify / add files u want to add.
# git add <file name>; (# git add <README.md>)
# git commit
# type the commit message 
# git status ( it will say your branch is ahead of master by 1 commit)
# git push origin HEAD:master ( HEAD points to your current branch name so this statement says push HEAD to master branch in remote origin server)
